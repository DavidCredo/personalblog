## The problem

I've been working on a RealityKit project recently and I stumbled upon a little problem: I wanted to add grounding shadows to my custom 3D models, which was straightforward for built-in primitives such as boxes or spheres, but not so much for custom models. In this article, I'll show you how to add grounding shadows to your custom 3D models in RealityKit.

When you add a custom 3D model to your RealityKit scene, it will not cast shadows on the ground or other objects by default. 
Shadows contribute a lot to the sense of presence (the degree to which the user feels like virtual objects are part of the real world) and realism of an AR experience, so it's important to get them right.

## The solution

Apple uses a technique called "grounding shadows" to cast shadows from 3D models onto the physical environment or other objects in the scene. 
While the actual solution is pretty simple, it's rather hidden in Apple's documentation. 
In order for a 3D model to cast shadows, it's Entity must have a `GroundingShadowComponent`. Built-in primitives like boxes or spheres have this component by default, because they are `ModelEntities`, but this is not necessarily the case for custom models.

The result looks like this:

<ContentImage src={shadow} alt="A 3D-model with a shadow beneath." subtitle="Now that's what i'm talking about! 🌚" />


Now let's dive in and see how i achieved this.
There are two ways to add a `GroundingShadowComponent` to your custom model:

### Option 1: Add the component manually in Reality Composer Pro

If you're using Reality Composer Pro to create your custom models, you can add a `GroundingShadowComponent` to your model by selecting the model in the scene hierarchy and clicking on the `Add Component` button in the inspector.
It's not sufficient to add the component to the root enity, you have to add it to each `ModelEntity` that you want to cast shadows.

### Option 2: Add the component programmatically

A more flexible way to add a `GroundingShadowComponent` to your custom model is to do it programmatically. 
I found a very handy extension on the RealityKit `Entity` class that allows you to enumerate all child entities of an entity and run a closure on each of them. This way you can add the `GroundingShadowComponent` to all entities that have a mesh.
The original code is from [this answer](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/733918) on the Apple Developer Forums. Shout out to user `drewolbrich` for providing this!

<Code code={code} lang="swift" wrap title="EntityExtensions.swift" theme="aurora-x"/>

Here's my understanding of the code:

The function `enumerateHierarchy` takes a closure as an argument. This closure takes two parameters: an `Entity` and a pointer to a Boolean. <br/>
You might be wondering why we need a pointer here, as this is an API that's isn't very common in every day Swift development (and often discouraged). The reason is that you might want to stop the enumeration at some point, for example if you've found the entity you were looking for. The pointer allows you to set the value of the Boolean to `true` in the closure, which will stop the enumeration. THe enumeration is executed recursively on all children and this will also stop the enumeration, because every recursion step has a reference to the same Boolean.


The function `enumerate` is a helper function that does all the work. It takes the same closure as an argument and calls it on the entity itself and all of its children.
It checks if the enumeration should be stopped, calls the closure on the entity itself and then recursively calls itself on all child entities.

<Code code={enumerateCode} lang="swift" wrap title="enumerate.swift" theme="aurora-x"/>


## How to use the extension

Now you can use this extension to add a `GroundingShadowComponent` to all ModelEntities in your 3D models hierarchy:

<Code code={`entity.enumerateHierarchy { entity, stop in
    if let modelEntity = entity as? ModelEntity {
        modelEntity.components[GroundingShadowComponent] = GroundingShadowComponent(castsShadow: true)
    }
}`} lang="swift" wrap title="SomeCustomEntity.swift" theme="aurora-x"/>

If you wanted to do this for every model in the scene, you could also use an `EntityQuery`. However, the approach I've presented here can be very handy if you don't want to add the component to every model in the scene.

I hope this little trick helps you to enhance the experience of your visionOS app!
