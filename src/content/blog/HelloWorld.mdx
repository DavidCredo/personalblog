# Hello World! 🌍

I won't be writing much here, but I wanted to say hello and welcome to my blog!<br/>
I like the idea of having  space on the internet. A place for [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/), sharing my thoughts and experiences, and hopefully helping others in the process.

## What is this blog about?
I'm studying software engineering (sort of, more on that in a future post!) and I'm interested in many different topics. I'll be writing about things like programming, technology, <br/> and if you got here from the homepage, you probably already know that I'm also interested in everything 3D. <br/>
I read a lot, so I'd like to share some of the books I read and what I learned from them. <br/>
I'm also interested in productivity, so I'll be writing about that as well. I'm also interested in... you get the idea.😄<br/>
I'll be writing about a lot of different things, but I'll try to keep it organized!

## What's the tech stack for this blog?
This blog is built with [Astro 🚀](https://astro.build/), a cool meta framework that is very handy for static sites like this. I'm using plain css for styling and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for writing posts.
Astro allows you to bring your own frontend framework. I'm using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for that, which is my favorite frontend framework at the moment. 
I plan to give a more detailed overview of the tech stack in a future post.

## What's next?
I'm currently working on my first post, so stay tuned for that!  

__See you soon! 👋__
